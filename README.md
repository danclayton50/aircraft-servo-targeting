# aircraft-servo-targeting

A script to take live data from the OpenSky API and map it into a radar-style GUI that shows nearby aircraft.

This can be later adapted to interface with servos on a Raspberry Pi to pointa stick at the nearest aircraft to help you spot it (code not currently public for servo interfacing).
